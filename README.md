# Hotel Network System Topology

This is a hotel network system topology designed in Cisco Packet Tracer, featuring a three-floor architecture with a total of 50 nodes. The network follows a hybrid topology, combining elements of mesh and hierarchical structures. At its core, three triangularly connected routers form a partial mesh topology, ensuring redundancy and efficient routing. Each router connects to a switch on its respective floor, following a hierarchical structure. The first floor includes the reception, backroom, and IT room, while the second floor features six rooms, a dining room, and a cyber caf√©. The third floor hosts a meeting room. Each floor is equipped with its own web server and DNS server, along with email and HTTP configurations to support guest and staff communications. This topology is designed to simulate a functional and scalable hotel network infrastructure, ensuring both reliability and efficient resource management across all areas.
